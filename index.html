        I'm a programmer, not a (auto-)biographer! Writing this bit isn't my forte.<br>
        (I'm also not a designer/front-end dev, hence this site isn't the prettiest.)<br>

        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
        I like to use the phrase "solution builder", like a problem solver, but actually putting together the solution too, rather than just thinking it up.<br>
        I'm familiar with Ruby (on Rails) and associated knowledge of HTML, previous experience in Java, dabbled in Python, tiny bit of CSS (mostly just for this site).<br>
        I've a reasonable amount of experience with JSON APIs, including one secured with OAuth2.<br>
        I'm a big fan of writing/contributing to software that bridges gaps, <a href="https://github.com/mennockramer/SubclassCommands">SubclassCommands</a> is an example of such software.<br> 
        I play (too much?) Destiny 2. The Black Armoury is the best foundry.<br>
        </p>

        <h3>Qualifications/Certifcations/Boxes Ticked</h3>
        <p>
        2:1 BSc Computer Science from University of Southampton (more details on my <a href="CV Menno Kramer.pdf">CV</a>).
        </p>
        <h3>Miscellaneous Hackery</h3>
        <p>
        I've got a Pi 1B running Raspbian Lite (CLI only) set up to automatically SSH into my desktop on boot. <br>
        The folder it SSHs into has several single-character-named batch files, most of which run commands to control <a href="https://openrgb.org">OpenRGB</a>.<br>
        There is a partial keyboard plugged into the Pi 1B. By pressing a matching character key (say, "1") then Enter, it will run the corresponding batch file (say, "1.bat"). <br>
        This acts as an existing-hardware alternative (the Pi 1B and keyboard were gathering dust) to products such as the Elgato Streamdeck. <br>
        It may have wider use-cases as it can do anything that can be done with a batch file or executable.
